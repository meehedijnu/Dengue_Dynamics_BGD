# Epidemiology and evolution of dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh, 2020-2023

## Description
Objective: The aim of the study is to provide a comprehensive
overview of the epidemiology and evolution of dengue virus (DV)
in Bangladesh from 2020 to 2023.
Methods: From January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2023, we
analyzed the daily press releases on the dengue situation made
public by the government. The published sequences from the
period were then subjected to phylogenetic analysis, amino acid
substitutions, evolutionary rate, and selection pressure analysis.
Results: In Bangladesh, dengue fever usually peaks during the
monsoon season. However, the increase in cases began considerably
earlier, at the end of April 2023 and the disease had claimed 1
705 lives, marking its highest annual death toll ever. Dhaka is the
city most severely affected. The phylogenetic analysis revealed
that the Bangladeshi DV-1 strains clustered far from any known
genotype, indicating the circulation of a novel genotype, whereas
the DV-3 strains clustered within the existing circulating genotype
I. The DV-1 strains had a total of 107 amino acid alterations and
two deletions, while the DV-3 strains had 17 alterations. The
Bangladeshi DV-1 and DV-3 strains evolve rapidly. Additionally,
selection pressure analysis revealed one positive selection site
in DV-1 and three in DV-3, respectively, which require further
research.
Conclusions: The circulation of novel genotypes, a higher mutation
rate, and positive selection of DV might result in the recent dengue
outbreaks in the country. The study will help in the development of
strategies to control outbreaks in Bangladesh and other nations with
similar conditions in the future.
